# TEXT_SUMMARAISATION 

Text summarization, yes, this NLP algorithm or technique has been a blessing for us. Text summarization is the practice of breaking down long publications into manageable paragraphs or sentences. The procedure extracts important information while also ensuring that the paragraph's sense is preserved. This shortens the time it takes to comprehend long materials like research articles while without omitting critical information.The process of constructing a concise, cohesive, and fluent summary of a lengthier text document, which includes highlighting the text's important points, is known as text summarization.

Data Preprocessing in NLP
1.Tokenization 
2.Lower casing
3.Stop words removal
4.Stemming
5.Lemmatization

Here, I have discussed the basic preprocessing steps that are required before building models in natural language processing that are fundamentals. These include tokenization, lowercasing the text, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization. Although the range with which natural language processing could be implemented is wide.
